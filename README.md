# House Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices using a dataset of various property features. The goal is to build a model that accurately estimates house prices based on factors like location, size, number of rooms, and more.

## Project Overview

The project is implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook and covers the following key steps:
- Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Prediction

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various features that influence house prices, such as:
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Size in square feet
- Location information
- Year built
- Amenities


## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-Learn for machine learning models

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook House_price_prediction.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the notebook cells to load the data, train models, and make predictions.

## Model

The following models were explored in the notebook:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

After training and evaluating the models, the best-performing model was selected based on its performance metrics, such as R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using common regression metrics:
- **R-Squared**: Indicates how well the model explains the variance in house prices.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average difference between predicted and actual prices.

(Add model results here, such as accuracy metrics and comparisons)

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with more advanced models and hyperparameter tuning.
- Collect more data to improve model generalization.
- Deploy the model as a web application for easy access.
